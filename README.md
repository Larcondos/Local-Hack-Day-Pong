# Local Hack Day Pong
This tutorial will walk you through the steps to creating your first Pong game in Phaser.io

### Requirements
- [Phaser](https://phaser.io/download)
- A simple HTML server (Instructions on how to set one up below if you need them!)

*If you have both of those things, you're ready to start coding!*

---

### Http Server Mini-Guide
However you want to set the server is up to you, but Node.js and Python make it really easy!

**Node.js**
* If you don't have `http-server` installed, you can get it using: `npm install http-server -g`.
* Navigate to your folder and run `http-server -a localhost -p 80` while inside

**Python**
* Navigate to your folder and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80` while inside

To get to your game, you'd visit `localhost:80` in your browser.
