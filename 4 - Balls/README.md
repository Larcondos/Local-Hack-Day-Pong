# Step 4 - Balls

This is one implementation of how balls could be added to the game.

NOTE: I recommend you use the knowledge from the previous steps to try to create an object, draw, animate, and collide the ball with the paddles/walls all on your own. Solving problems is key and this is a great opportunity to struggle and learn!
